## Why do I want to join IRIS Systems?

I have a deep interest in the domain of computer systems and want to understand internally how the internet and websites work. I think IRIS Systems is a good platform for learning the internal architecture and the BTS of how real-world deployed websites work. I will be able to learn a lot and also I have heard the people in IRIS Systems are really nice and fun.
