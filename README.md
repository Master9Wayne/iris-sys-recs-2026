## About Me 😊

Hi, I'm Aradhya.<br>
I am from B-Tech CSE 2nd Year.<br>
I like problem solving and am very passionate about systems, particularly the domain of networking. I like understanding how the technology we use every day actually works behind the scenes rather than just using it. I want to join IRIS Systems because I feel it is a good platform for understanding the internal architecture of real-world deployed websites and getting invaluable experience. Also I have heard the people in IRIS Systems are really nice and fun 😉.
